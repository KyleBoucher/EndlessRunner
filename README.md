---- Features I wanted to add ---- 
- Moving camera based on player location/platform jumping
- Bouncing obstacles on platforms (The slow down mechanic was meant for this feature)
  - OR Collectable items

---- Known Bugs ----
- Landing on edge of platform can cause the character to become stuck.
- Character can fall off edges of platform if jumping between platforms while moving slowly
- Platform generation can sometimes create impossible paths (small platforms, etc)
- At high movement speeds could possibly run out of platforms
